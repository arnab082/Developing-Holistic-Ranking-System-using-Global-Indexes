# Developing Holistic Ranking System using Global Indexes


Countries have long been classified as developed, developing, or underdeveloped based on factors such as GDP, education, and healthcare. However, this subjective classification lacks a standardized ranking system, making it difficult for countries to identify their strengths and weaknesses and make informed decisions in international relations. To address this issue, this paper proposes a data analytics system that collectively ranks countries using three world indexes, covering various factors that affect a country's overall development. By applying Principal Component Analysis, the system extracts important variables and identifies underlying development factors. Clustering countries based on scores obtained from ICA can group them into appropriate categories, providing an accurate and standardized assessment of performance on a world level, helping leaders and policymakers make informed decisions.
